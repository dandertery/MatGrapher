# MatGrapher
MatGrapher is an A-Level AQA Computer Science NEA project designed to target teachers and students for A-level Further Mathematics working on matrix properties and transformations.
# MatGrapher Introduction
(Taken from the report produced for the project linked below):  
Matrices are a type of data structure used to represent mathematical objects and simplify complex operations. They are prevalent in both Computer Science and Mathematics with applications in areas such as linear algebra, graph theory, computer graphics and cryptography. Matrix properties can be illustrated through linear algebra and graphing.
The client broadly wishes for a matrix transformation grapher that can animate the application of matrices on 2D vectors and functions, manipulating and describing matrix properties. The software should be appropriate for educational use by A Level Further Maths students and be mathematically sound. The program is intended to help users visualise and illustrate matrix transformations and their key properties. Matrix transformations can feel very abstract for students and responsive graphing with enough freedom to revisit specific core ideas will assist a student struggling with the extensive matrices topics. The value of visual graphing and animation in cementing the mathematical principles of matrix transformations can be seen in the success of linear algebra videos by the likes of 3Blue1Brown, a mathematics Youtuber.
